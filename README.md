# route-api

### Description:
This api has capability of finding whether a route exist between two cities, based on the configurable cities and roads among them. List of roads is available in a file. The file contains a list of city pairs (one pair per line, comma separated), which indicates that thereâ€™s a road between those cities. An example content of input file is shown below. 'Boston, New York' line in the file tells us that there is a way to go from Boston to New york and New york to Boston.

### Assumption:
  the city names in the input are case insensitive.

### Example Input file:
* Boston, New York 
* Philadelphia, Newark 
* Newark, Boston 
* Trenton, Albany 

### Expected Output:
* The api will respond with 'Yes' 
	* if the source city is Newark and destination city is New York and
	* if the source city is Trenton and destination city is Albany.
* The api will respond with 'No'
	* if the source city is Trenton and destination city is Newark.
